# Hacktoberfest_2020

Hacktoberfest is a month-long virtual festival to celebrate open source software in partnership with Github. It is celebrated in the month of October every year. All you have to do is contribute to any open source projects and make at least 4 pull requests within the month of October.



The first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize. (Do it soon, let's start! ;) )
